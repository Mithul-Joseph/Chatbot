# Chatbot

This project aims at implementing a chatbot using the state of the art OpenAI's gpt3 model.  

Some of the steps involved include,
- making API call and creating the chatbot.
- running it as a web application using flask.
- packaging the application inside a docker container. 

## Motivation
I have always wondered how a chatbot used to run in the backend and I wanted to create one on my own. So I developed a chatbot and hence this project.

## Demo
A practical demonstration is shown in the video below :relaxed:

Shoutout to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for providing us with such a great model.
